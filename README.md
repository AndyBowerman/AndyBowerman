# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andy

I'm a Bristol based software developer and I've just completed the 12 week _nology bootcamp.

Some technologies I enjoy using:
- CSS/SASS
- JavaScript
- React

I've also recently started working with Java & Spring Boot to create my own API's.

You can see some of my work here:

- When I'm not coding I enjoy playing and watching all kinds of sport :soccer:
